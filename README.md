# SudukoSolver

An application that attempts to solve sudoku puzzles using strategies.

It uses logic to solve as much of the puzzle as possible. This is enough
to solve the majority of sudoku puzzles but if required it will use a trial
and error approach once the number of permutations has been reduced to a
manageable level.

I don't claim that it will be able to solve every puzzle.
