# SudukoSolver

An application that attempts to solve sudoku puzzles using strategies.

Currently I've only implemented the strategies that I already know. As such it
is capable of solving moderately difficult puzzles but not harder puzzles that
requiring more complex strategies.

I intend to research and implement more strategies but that may have to wait
until winter now that the covid lock down has eased.
